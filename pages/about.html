      <h2>About This Site</h2>
      <p>
        The <b>Shelf Recommendations project</b> was launched in 2018 to present
        information on the status of the extended continental shelf submissions.
        Our goal is to provide a visualisation of the areas of extended
        continental shelf and an examination of the recommendations made to
        States by the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (the
        Commission).
      </p>
      <p>
        As coastal states are presenting their submissions to the Commission, it
        is useful to have an accessible record of previous recommendations.
        Since 2008 the Commission has developed understandings, devised
        consistent approaches and precedents with respect to the characteristics
        of continental margins and the application of Article 76 of the
        Convention. This website provides an analysis of the Commission's
        general view on matters such as the submerged prolongation of the
        landmass of coastal States, the implications of seafloor highs and
        particularly oceanic seafloor spreading ridges and sediment transport
        deposits. It is hoped this information will assist States in making a
        successful submission to the Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
        The information and data provided has been collected from the published
        submission executive summaries, summaries of recommendations and full
        recommendations (from States that have given due publicity to the outer
        limit of their continental shelf in accordance with article 84 (2) of
        the Convention) available on the DOALOS website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data on the submissions and recommendations have been provided by the
        United States Geological Survey, the University of Sydney, the Norwegian
        Petroleum Directorate and GRID-Arendal. The project is majority funded
        by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr Phil Symond's
        participation is supported by the Australian Department of Foreign
        Affair and Geoscience Australia.

      <h3>The Extended Continental Shelf</h3>
      <p>
        The continental shelf extends to the outer edge of the continental
        margin - or out to a distance of 200 M if the outer edge of the
        continental margin does not extend that far. If a coastal State intends
        to establish its continental shelf beyond 200 M (known as the extended
        continental shelf, or ECS), it must submit information to the Commission
        on the Limits of the Continental Shelf as defined in
        <a
          href="https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part6.htm"
          >Article 76 of UNCLOS</a
        >. Article 76 defines the legal continental shelf and the process of
        delineating its outer limits. Setting these limits ensures the right of
        coastal states to explore and exploit the resources of the seabed and
        subsoil, but excludes the water column and the airspace.

      <h3>The Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf</h3>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/commission_members.htm"
          >21 members of the Commission</a
        >
        are elected by the State Parties to UNCLOS, with at least 3 members
        coming from each of the geographical regions of the United Nations.
        Members are elected for 5 years. The last election took place in June
        2017 when 20 members were elected, of these 9 were newly elected and 11
        were returning members. The Commission is currently in its 5th term
        (1997-2002, 2002-2007, 2007-2012, 2012-2017, 2017-2022).
      </p>

      <p>
        The Commission is responsible for making recommendations on the outer
        limits of the continental shelf to States in accordance with the
        Convention, based on the data and information presented in the
        submission. The Commission, operational since 1997, is guided by the
        Rules of Procedure (CLCS 2008) and the Scientific and Technical
        Guidelines of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf
        (CLCS 1999), referred to as the Guidelines. The recommendations given by
        the Commission, may or may not agree with the limits of the continental
        shelf submitted by the State. In the case of divergence between a State
        regarding the recommendations made by the Commission, the State may,
        within a reasonable time, make a revised or new submission (for example
        the Russian submission was first lodged in 2001 with partial revised
        submissions submitted in 2013 and 2015).
      </p>
      <h3>The Scientific and Technical Guidelines</h3>
      <p>
        The
        <a
          href="https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/n99/171/08/img/n9917108.pdf?OpenElement"
          >Scientific and Technical Guidelines</a
        >
        (1999; STG) where prepared by Commission in order to clarify its
        interpretation of the scientific, technical and legal terms contained in
        UNCLOS. The Commission felt this was necessary as the Convention makes
        use of scientific terms in a legal context which at times departs
        significantly from accepted scientific definition (e.g. the continental
        shelf). In addition, terms in the Convention are at times open to
        multiple interpretations and the aim of the guidelines is to ensure a
        uniform understanding. The guidelines also aim to provide guidance on
        the admissible scientific and technical evidence examined by the
        Commission and outline possible methodologies to develop the evidence
        (acknowledging that there may be other suitable methodologies). The
        Commission emphasizes methodologies that are optimise existing
        information and data and are thus cost effective.
      </p>
      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <h3>The Sub-commission</h3>
      <p>
        As outlined in the Rules of Procedure, the Commission establishes a
        sub-commission for the consideration of each submission. Sub-commissions
        meet privately but throughout the process are able to openly communicate
        with the state making the submission. They may request additional data
        and information. In some instances, the complexity of requests can
        amount to the recommendation of a revised submission. It is not clear
        how the sub-commission determines when to stop requesting more
        information and decide that a revised submission is required, but this
        is likely determined on a situational basis. A revised submission
        provides public documentation of changes made and an indication of how
        the sub-commission is assessing specific situations. However, in some
        situations, not enough information is provided to assess why the
        sub-commission chose to deny or revise ECS claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Commission and the sub-commissions endeavour to reach a consensus in
        relation to the recommendations. However, if a consensus cannot be
        achieved, decisions can be made with the agreement of a two-thirds
        majority of the members present and voting. This means that all parts of
        all recommendations are not necessarily agreed to by all members of the
        Commission, but are, at a minimum, supported by a two-thirds majority of
        members in attendance.
      </p>
      <h3>Workload of the Commission</h3>
      <p>
        Owing to the increase in workload of the Commission some changes in
        operation have been made. The annual meeting time in New York has
        increased, the number of simultaneous sub-commissions operating has
        increased (from 3 to 4) and at times the number of members (generally 7)
        in a sub-commission has been reduced to allow additional sub-commissions
        to operate. However, these measures have not significantly increased the
        rate of completed recommendations, as the processing time for
        examination of submissions has on average increased. This may in part be
        due to the complexity of submissions, but also the amount of time it
        takes new members of the Commission to become familiar with the
        Guidelines, and approaches and precedents that have been set in previous
        recommendations.
